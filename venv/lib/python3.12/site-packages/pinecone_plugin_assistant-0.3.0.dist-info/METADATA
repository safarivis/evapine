# Assistant

Interact with Pinecone's Assistant APIs, e.g. create, manage, and chat with assistants (currently in beta). Pinecone Assistant is also available in the [console](https://app.pinecone.io/).


## Quickstart
The following example highlights how to use an assistant to store and understand documents on a particular topic and chat with
the assistant about those documents with the ultimate goal of semantically understanding your data.

```python
from pinecone import Pinecone
from pinecone_plugins.assistant.models.chat import Message

pc = Pinecone(api_key='<<PINECONE_API_KEY>>')

# Create an assistant (in this case we'll store documents about planets)
space_assistant = pc.assistant.create_assistant(assistant_name="space")

# Upload information to your assistant
space_assistant.upload_file("./space-fun-facts.pdf")

# Once the upload succeeded, ask the assistant a question
msg = Message(content="How old is the earth?")
resp = space_assistant.chat_completions(messages=[msg])
print(resp)

# {'choices': [{'finish_reason': 'stop',
# 'index': 0,
# 'message': {'content': 'The age of the Earth is estimated to be '
#                         'about 4.54 billion years, based on '
#                         'evidence from radiometric age dating of '
#                         'meteorite material and Earth rocks, as '
#                         'well as lunar samples. This estimate has '
#                         'a margin of error of about 1%.',
#             'role': 'assistant'}}],
# 'id': '00000000000000001a377ceeaabf3c18',

```

## Assistants API

### Create Assistant
To create an assistant, see the below example. This API creates a assistant with the specified name, metadata, and optional timeout settings.

```python
from pinecone import Pinecone

pc = Pinecone(api_key='<<PINECONE_API_KEY>>')
metadata = {"author": "Jane Doe", "version": "1.0"}

assistant = pc.assistant.create_assistant(
    assistant_name="example_assistant", 
    instructions="Always use British English spelling and vocabulary.",

    timeout=30
)
```

Arguments:
- `assistant_name` The name to assign to the assistant. 
    - type: `str`
- `instructions`  Custom instructions for the assistant. These will be applied to all future chat interactions.
    - type: `Optional[str] = None` 
- `metadata`: A dictionary containing metadata for the assistant.
    - type: `Optional[dict[str, any]] = None`
- `timeout`: Specify the number of seconds to wait until assistant operation is completed. 
    - If None, wait indefinitely until operation completes
    - If >=0, time out after this many seconds
    - If -1, return immediately and do not wait. 
    - type: `Optional[int] = None`

Returns:

### Chat
Performs a chat request to the following assistant which returns a stream of chat results in our custom format. Use this API if you want to have more control over the format of the citations. If the stream bool is set to `true`, this function will stream the response in chunks by returning a generator. 

```python

from pinecone_plugins.assistant.models.chat import Message

pc = Pinecone(api_key='<<PINECONE_API_KEY>>')

space_assistant = pc.assistant.Assistant(assistant_name="space")

msg = Message(content="How old is the earth?")
resp = space_assistant.chat(messages=[msg])
